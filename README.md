# Computational Macroeconomics — University of Mannheim

*This is a preliminary version (September 1, 2025)*

This repository contains code and lecture materials for the *Computational Macroeconomics* course in the Master's program at the University of Mannheim (Fall 2025).

## Contents

- **`Lec01_Introduction.pdf`**  
  Course introduction

- **`Lec01_JuliaPrimer.ipynb`**  
  Provides a brief review of essential programming concepts in Julia that are extensively used in solving macroeconomic models.

- **`Lec02_TwoPeriod.ipynb`**  
  Solves a two-period consumption-saving model to demonstrate core solution techniques in computational macroeconomics:
  - Grid search
  - Endogenous Grid Method (EGM)
  - Projection method

- **`Lec03_MultiPeriod.ipynb`**  
  Introduces the multi-period model and demonstrates how to solve it using backward induction.

- **`Lec04_GE.ipynb`**  
  Explains how to solve the general equilibrium (GE).

- **`Lec05_Calibration.ipynb`**  
  Explains the basic idea of the calibration.

- **`Lec06_Counterfactual.ipynb`**  
  Serves as a coding session for solving for the stationary equilibrium and simulating reforms related to social security schemes.

- **`Lec07_Transition.ipynb`**  
  Explains the algorithm for solving transitional dynamics, using the effects of education subsidies in a two-period model with endogenous human capital as an example.

- **`Lec08_InfiniteHorizon.ipynb`**  
  Explains algorithms for solving the infinite-horizon household optimization problem, such as value function iteration and policy function iteration.

- **`Lec09_NumericalMethod.ipynb`**  
  Explains concepts and algorithms for major numerical problems: root finding (bisection and Newton–Raphson methods), numerical optimization (golden-section search and Newton’s method), and function approximation (interpolation).

- **`Lec10_NumericalMethod_Ex.ipynb`**  
  Serves as a coding session for implementing the numerical methods from Lecture 9 to solve a static consumption–leisure problem.

- **`Lec11_Aiyagari.ipynb`**  
  Explains (1) the Aiyagari model and (2) Tauchen's method in discretizing the AR(1) income process.

- **`Lec12_Aiyagari_Ex.ipynb`**  
  Serves as a coding session for solving the Aiyagari model with (1) endogenous labor supply and (2) taxation and income redistribution by the government.
