    "# Exercises on Aiyagari model: roles of taxation and redistribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is primarily based on [lecture notes by Toshihiko Mukoyama (Georgetown University)](https://toshimukoyama.github.io/MyWebsite/Lecture2_Tokyo.pdf). All errors herein are mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a government who imposes wealth tax $\\tau$ (ie., take away $\\tau a$) from households and transfer back in lump-sum manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce such government into the model, considering government budget balance. Set $\\tau=0.05$. Equilibrium lump-sum tax, $T$, is determined endogenously.\n",
    "- Evaluate the welfare effects of the policy based on the ex-ante perspective. That is, compute the consumption equivalence according to the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{z\\mid z_0}\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty u(c^0_t(a_t,z_t)(1+\\lambda)) = \\mathbb{E}_{z\\mid z_0}\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty u(c^1_t(a_t,z_t)),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "$c^0_t(a_t,z_t)$ and $c^1_t(a_t,z_t)$ denote the consumption policy with and without the wealth tax.\n",
    "- Does the policy improve (ex-ante) welfare? If so, why? Do the welfare implications differ if income is less volatile? (e.g., smaller $\\sigma$)\n",
    "- (Optional) Solve the transitional dynamics."
