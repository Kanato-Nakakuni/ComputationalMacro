    "### Setup  \n",
    "Consider a general equilibrium model populated by overlapping generations. The goal of this assignment is to solve and calibrate the model and to conduct several counterfactual experiments using it. The economy consists of two sectors: households and firms, both of which are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Household\n",
    "Let $j$ denote age in the model. A cohort of households enters the economy without assets and lives for $J\\,(=61)$ periods. Households are ex-ante heterogeneous in skill levels. In particular, each household is endowed with a skill level that is fixed over the life cycle. Skill type is denoted by $s\\in\\{L,H\\}$, where $L$ stands for low skill (e.g., high-school graduates) and $H$ stands for high skill (e.g., college graduates). The population shares of high- and low-skill households in each cohort are $\\omega_H$ and $\\omega_L$, respectively, with $\\omega_H\\in(0,1)$ and $\\omega_L\\equiv 1-\\omega_H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each period, households derive utility from consumption $c_j$ and leisure $l_j$, and discount future utility by factor $\\beta$. In each period they choose consumption and next period’s asset holdings $a_{j+1}$. Borrowing is not allowed, i.e., $a_{j+1}\\ge 0$. Assets earn interest rate $r$. For $j\\le J_R\\,(=46)$, households also choose hours worked $n_j$ and earn gross labor income $w_s n_j$, where $w_s$ is the market wage for skill type $s$. The time endowment is normalized to 1, so households allocate time between work $n_j$ and leisure $1-n_j$. At the end of age $J_R$, households retire from the labor market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mu(j)$ denote the measure of age-$j$ households, normalized so that $\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\mu(j)=1$. If we assume zero population growth, cohort masses are constant: $\\mu(j)=\\mu(j')$ for any $j,j'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The household problem for skill type $s$ is given by:\n",

    "\\begin{align*}\n",
