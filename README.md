# Computational Macroeconomics â€” University of Mannheim (Fall 2025)

This repository contains code and lecture materials for the *Computational Macroeconomics* course in the Master's program at the University of Mannheim (Fall 2025).

## Contents

- **`Lec2_TwoPeriod.ipynb`**  
  Solves a two-period consumption-saving model to demonstrate core solution techniques in computational macroeconomics:
  - Grid search
  - Endogenous Grid Method (EGM)
  - Projection method

- **`Lec3_MultiPeriod.ipynb`**  
  Introduces the multi-period model and demonstrates how to solve it using backward induction and dynamic programming principles.
