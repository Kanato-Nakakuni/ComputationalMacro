    "# Exercises on Aiyagari model: roles of taxation and redistribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is primarily based on [lecture notes by Prof. Toshihiko Mukoyama (Georgetown University)](https://toshimukoyama.github.io/MyWebsite/Lecture2_Tokyo.pdf). All errors herein are mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a government who imposes wealth tax $\\tau$ (ie., take away $\\tau a$) from households and transfer back in lump-sum manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "0. (Optional, if time permits) Refactor the code by separating it into: (i) a function for solving the household problem with interest rate as input, (ii) a routine for solving general equilibrium, and (iii) a struct for model parameters. Place each component in its own Julia source file (e.g., `household.jl`, `equilibrium.jl`, `params.jl`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Endogenous labor supply: Consider that now the periodic utility function is given as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U(c,l) = \\frac{(c^\\omega l^{1-\\omega})^{1-\\mu}}{1-\\mu},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $l\\in(0,1)$ denotes the time spent in leisure, given the time endowment of 1. $\\omega\\in(0,1)$ is the weight parameter between consumption and leisure. The labor earnings are now given as $wz(1-l)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - We need to change the function `solve_household` by adding leisure-labor choices (see Lecture Notes 3 and 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, define a new parameter structure, say, `Params`, by including $\\omega$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Introduce such government into the model, considering government budget balance. Set $\\tau=0.05$. Equilibrium lump-sum tax, $T$, is determined endogenously. You may set $\\omega=0.4$.  \n",
    "  - We need to change the function `solve_household` by including $\\tau$ and $T$ as additional inputs and by adding them to the budget constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - We also need to change the function `solve_stationary` by including $\\tau$ and $T$ as additional inputs, and by adding an update for $T$ to check whether the government budget constraint $\\tau K = T$ is satisfied.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluate the welfare effects of the policy based on the ex-ante perspective. That is, compute the consumption equivalence according to the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty u(c^0_t(a_t,z_t)(1+\\lambda),l^0_t(a_t,z_t)) = \\mathbb{E}\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty u(c^1_t(a_t,z_t),l^1_t(a_t,z_t)),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where functions with super script 0 and 1 denote the equilibrium policy functions without and with the wealth tax. The right-hand side can be easily computed based on the equilibrium value function and the stationary distribution $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In computing the CEV, you may construct additional functions: (1) `imp_value`, which returns the expected lifetime utility given baseline policy functions, the value function, and the distribution, with input $\\lambda$; and (2) `compute_CEV`, which computes CEV using `imp_value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1. Does the policy improve (ex-ante) welfare? If so, why? You may decompose the welfare change into the change in the distribution and the change in the value function, given that the right-hand side is defined as $\\sum_{x} V(x)\\, m(x)$, where $x$ is the state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2. Do the welfare implications of the redistribution policy differ if income is less volatile (e.g., smaller $\\sigma$) (optional: or if the labor supply is exogenous i.e., fixed at the level in the initial economy)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "3.3. (Optional) Solve the transitional dynamics."
